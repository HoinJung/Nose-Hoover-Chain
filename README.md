# Nose-Hoover-Chain
Canonical Ensemble in Molecular Dynamics (NVT Ensemble), Nose-Hoover Chain   

It follows Frenkel & Smit 's book "Understanding Molecular Simulation From Algorithms to Applications"    

I attached a report for this project, incluidng entire Algorithm, backgrounds, program information, analysis of results.   

Read pdf file 'NVT ensemble for LJ-fluid with Nose-Hoover Chain'
